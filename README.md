📈 **Linear Regression - Machine Learning Project**
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of **Linear Regression** using Python and scikit-learn. It's designed as a beginner-friendly introduction to building, training, evaluating, and deploying a machine learning model.

### 🔍 Project Highlights

* Understand the core concept of Linear Regression
* Train a model using `scikit-learn`
* Visualize predictions with `matplotlib`
* Evaluate performance using MSE and R² Score
* Save and load models using `joblib` for deployment

### ⚙️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/linear-regression.git`
2. Install the required libraries:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open the notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and run them in sequence.

### 📦 Pretrained Model

A trained model is available in the `models/` directory Eg : (`sales_model.joblib`) for quick testing. You can load it using:

```python
import joblib
model = joblib.load('models/sales_model.joblib') #  (replace that file name with the desired model)
```

To run that model, firstly u need to make a numpy array with the exact column values that were used in the latest dataframe , and then predict using :
```python
import joblib
model = joblib.load('models/sales_model.joblib') #  (replace that file name with the desired model)
model.predict(np.array([1, 3, 2])
```

### 📦 Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* joblib

### 🧠 Concepts Covered

* Simple Linear Regression theory and implementation
* Data preparation and feature-label separation
* Model training and prediction
* Evaluation metrics: Mean Squared Error, R² Score
* Model persistence with `joblib`

### ✅ Future Plans

* Extend to multivariate linear regression
* Add polynomial regression
* Integrate real-world datasets via APIs
