# 📈 Linear Regression: A Collection of Projects and Topics

This repository is a **comprehensive collection of projects, notebooks, and scripts exploring Linear Regression** in its many forms. Each file or subfolder covers a different topic or dataset, but all are centered around understanding, implementing, and extending linear regression using Python and relevant libraries.

---

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

- Each file or subdirectory focuses on a unique aspect, dataset, or extension of linear regression.
- Topics include:
  - Simple and Multiple Linear Regression
  - Feature engineering and preprocessing
  - Evaluation metrics: MSE, RMSE, R², etc.
  - Real-world datasets (e.g., sales, housing, advertising)
  - Model persistence (saving/loading)
  - Visualizations of results

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sushrut2007/Linear-Regression.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore topics:**
   - Open any notebook (`.ipynb`) or script (`.py`) in the root or subdirectories.
   - Follow the instructions/comments within each file to understand its focus.

---

## 🧩 Example Topics Covered

- **Basic Linear Regression**: Theory and implementation.
- **Multivariate Regression**: Using multiple features to improve predictions.
- **Visualization**: Plotting regression lines, residuals, and feature relationships.
- **Model Evaluation**: Calculating and interpreting scores.
- **Saving & Loading Models**: Using `joblib` or `pickle`.
- **Working with Different Datasets**: Each script may use a unique dataset for demonstration.
